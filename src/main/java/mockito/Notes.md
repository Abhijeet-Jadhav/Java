Abstract :
abstract is a keyword shared by a multitude of object-oriented programming languages. 
Methods and classes can be marked abstract to indicate that they do not contain the full implementation of application 
logic and have to be extended. Abstract classes can not be instantiated and serve the purpose of providing a uniform interface for their subclasses, as well as the implementation of common methods that don't have to be reimplemented for each subclass.

Abstract Class:
Abstract classes are classes which cannot be instantiated. 
They exist to provide common functionality and interface specifications to several concrete classes.
Provide uniform interface to the subclasses.

An abstract class can be used as a type of template for other classes. The abstract class will hold common functionality
for all classes that extend it.

Abstract Method:
An abstract method is one with only a signature and no implementation body. 
It is often used to specify that a subclass must provide an implementation of the method.
